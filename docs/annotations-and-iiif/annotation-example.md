title: Annotation example
---

So we now have the basic concept of an annotation, lets look at an example.

Remember how we previously saw how `otherContent` enabled us to link to a `AnnotationList`? Here is a live example:

Within the 3rd canvas, on the manifest: https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299843

```json
...
"otherContent": [
  {
    "@id": "https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299843/list/47174892",
    "@type": "sc:AnnotationList"
  }
],
...
```

If we then open the URL for that `AnnotationList` you can see several Annotation resources.

```json
...
{
  "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json",
  "@id": "https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/annotations/76408",
  "@type": "oa:Annotation",
  "motivation": [
    "oa:commenting"
  ],
  "on": {
    "@type": "oa:SpecificResource",
    "full": "https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299843/canvas/canvas-47174892",
    "selector": {
      "@type": "oa:FragmentSelector",
      "value": "xywh=886,920,485,485"
    },
    "within": {
      "@id": "https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299843",
      "@type": "sc:Manifest"
    }
  },
  "resource": [
    {
      "@type": "dctypes:Text",
      "chars": "<p>age: 56<br/>gender: Male</p><p>Generated by Microsoft Cognitive Services</p>",
      "format": "text/html"
    }
  ]
},
...
```

Here we can see that the annotation resource has a selector using the `on` property that references the canvas `https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299843/canvas/canvas-47174892`. That `on` property also has a selector called a W3C Media  [`FragmentSelector`](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/specific.html#FragmentSelector).

### Selectors

Let's take a quick look at the selector used in this annotation. Annotations can have multiple selectors, this one uses the previously mentioned W3C Media Fragment Selector.

The fragment selector specifies a square region of the `Canvas` that is being targeted using coordinates.

`xywh=886,920,485,485` translates to, starting at the X coordinate of 886 and Y coordinate of 920, select a region that is 485 pixels wide by 485 pixels tall.

> **Question** It looks like this annotation was generated using Microsoft Cognitive Services. What problems do you see with using a service like this? What benefits are there to using a service like this?
