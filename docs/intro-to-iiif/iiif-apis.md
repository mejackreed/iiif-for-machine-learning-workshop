title: Technical specifications
---

IIIF has several [stable specifications](https://iiif.io/technical-details/), each with a distinct purpose and use cases that they serve.

 - [IIIF Image API](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/) - Used to deliver "pixels" to end users
 - [IIIF Presentation API](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1) - "Just enough metadata to drive a viewing experience"
 - [IIIF Authentication API](https://iiif.io/api/auth/1.0) - An authentication specification and workflow for providing authentication for IIIF images
 - [IIIF Search API](https://iiif.io/api/search/1.0) - Used to "search within" IIIF content

## Coming soon, IIIF Image and Presentation v3.0
While these have not yet been released in their final form, coming soon is a v3.0 of the Image and Presentation APIs.

 - [IIIF Image API v3.0](https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/) - https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/
 - [IIIF Presentation API v3.0](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) - https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/

**IIIF Presentation API v3.0 now supports audio and visual content!**


## Reflection

> **Question:** How could these APIs benefit machine learning applications?

> **Question:** How can you use machine learning to create data/metadata for your digital content?
