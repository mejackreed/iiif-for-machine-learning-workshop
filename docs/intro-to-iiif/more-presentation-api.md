## Sample Presentation API response

A simple IIIF Presentation API response looks something like this:

Because this object only contains one image, its `Sequence` only contains one `Canvas`. A book might have more canvases, one representing each page.


## Request / Response cycle

While Image API requests can of course be made independently from Presentation API requests, they are often combined. Viewers will often

## Linking other content

One really useful thing to note about the IIIF Presentation API is that it enables you to start linking other types of content to your manifest. A few different ways to link other content exist.

### `seeAlso`
> A link to a machine readable document that semantically describes the resource with the seeAlso property, such as an XML or RDF description. https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/#seealso

An example:

```json
// From https://dms-data.stanford.edu/data/manifests/Parker/wz026zp2442/manifest.json
...
"seeAlso": {
  "@id": "https://purl.stanford.edu/wz026zp2442.mods",
  "format": "application/mods+xml"
},
...
```

### `otherContent`
The `otherContent` property enables you to link other content including `AnnotationList` to a manifest.

```json
// From https://dms-data.stanford.edu/data/manifests/Parker/wz026zp2442/manifest.json
...
"otherContent": [
  {
    "@type": "sc:AnnotationList",
    "@id": "https://dms-data.stanford.edu/data/manifests/Parker/wz026zp2442/list/1r.json"
  }
]
...
```

> **Question:** Now that we know more about the Presentation API, how could this be used to programatically access images for machine learning? How could you enhance resources using the Presentation API?
