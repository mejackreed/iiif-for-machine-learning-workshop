title: IIIF as a solution

## IIIF aims to simplify things

IIIF provides specifications for serving and consuming images on the web. Instead of having to reinvent how to do this, organizations can benefit from using IIIF compatible software for viewing and serving out images. One convenience this offers is that you can replace your viewer without having to replace your image server, or vice versa. Beyond implementation conveniences, IIIF offers interoperability with other digital content and platforms enable more reuse, without having to rehost.

IIIF is:
 - A community that develops shared APIs
 - implements them in software
 - exposes interoperable content

## IIIF not only enables interoperable content and software, it enables adopters to build rich viewing and usage experiences.
