title: Other IIIF APIs
---

Beyond the Image and Presentation APIs, IIIF provides a few other APIs to enable better reuse of content. This workshop will not go too deep into these, but wanted to make you aware of them.

## Search API

The IIIF Search API enables search within a specific IIIF object. An example here would be searching within a book or document. It is important to note, that the IIIF Search API does not enable searching across IIIF content, but just within a single object.

Here is an example of using a IIIF Search API within the Mirador viewer. Try out some other searches.
