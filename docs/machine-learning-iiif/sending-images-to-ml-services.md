title: Sending IIIF images to commercial machine learning services
---

Remember that Van Gogh painting that we saw earlier with the annotations created by Microsoft Cognitive services?

We can try something similar with our image of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from earlier.

1. Navigate to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/
1. Enter in the IIIF Image API url in the "Image URL" field: `https://stacks.stanford.edu/image/iiif/hg676jb4964%2F0380_796-44/full/512,/0/default.jpg`
1. Click "Submit"
1. Try some other IIIF Image API urls. Experiment with the size parameters to see if there is an optimal size you can use.
