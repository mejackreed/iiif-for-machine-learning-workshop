### How does it use machine learning?

 - Automated and manual image cleaning
 - Image template matching
 - Feature extraction
 - Automated path finding
 - Vector graph extraction from images
 - User facilitated machine learning

### How does it use IIIF?

 - Uses the Image API as the glue between client interaction and image processing  
 - Import / export of content through the Presentation API  
 - Easily extended to new types of content and research areas that already use IIIF
